/**
 * Velocity User Guide :
 * Normally, when a template contains a bad reference an error message is logged and 
 * (unless it is part of a #set or #if), the reference is included verbatim in a page. 
 * With the InvalidReferenceEventHandler this behavior can be changed. 
 * Substitute values can be inserted, invalid references may be logged, or an exception can be thrown. 
 * Multiple InvalidReferenceEventHandler's may be chained. 
 * The exact manner in which chained method calls behave will differ per method. (See the javadoc for the details).
